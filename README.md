# CarInsuranceDB
In this project, I designed and implemented a Relational Database for a fictional car insurance company. All data within the project is also fictional. The documentation is available in the file "Car Insurance DB - documentation.docx".
The project was implemented within 4 stages:
1. Designing an ERD (Entity Relational Diagram)
2. Preparing an RDB Schema based on ERD
3. Implementation in SQL
4. Populating the DB with data
5. Preparing custom queries in SQL
